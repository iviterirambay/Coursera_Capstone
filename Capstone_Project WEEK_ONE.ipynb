        "which is unrelated to the causes or severity of accidents) or are redundant (i.e. they\n",

        "column).\n",
        "2. The dataset contains categorical data, e.g. weather, which takes one of eleven categorical values, or roadcond which describes road conditions and takes one of eight\n",
        "categorical values. Machine learning models require numerical data, not categorical\n",
        "data. For this reason it will also be necessary to re-cast the accident severity scale\n",
        "such that it is strictly numerical: 0, 1, 2, 2b, 3 → 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n",
        "3. The dataset contains missing entries, where one or more of the key predictor variables\n",
        "are absent or uninformative (e.g. 6.8% of accidents have “Unknown” listed in the\n",
        "weather column). Including these data entries in the model is likely to increase noise.\n",
        "In some cases, the target variable itself is not in a usable form (4.25% of accidents have\n",
        "severitycode “Unknown”). We see that some dependent variables are categorical (of type\n",
        "object), whereas they need to be numerical for most Machine Leaning approaches to work. We will use\n",
        "one-hot encoding to recast each of these categorical variables as a series of numerical variables, with values\n",
        "0 or 1.\n",
        "4. The numerical data are imbalanced (there are ∼ 345× as many accidents with severitycode=1 as there are accidents with severitycode=3) and are not well normalised\n",
        "(e.g. after one-hot encoding many of the categorical variables will be assigned binary\n",
        "values 0/1, whereas the latitude, X and longitude, Y of the accident location are in\n",
        "decimal degrees, and typically cluster around X = −122.33, Y = 47.61)\n",
        "In order to use this dataset to build and evaluate a Machine Learning model for predicting accident severity it will be necessary to clean the data using the following standard\n",
        "techniques: (i) discarding rows which are missing crucial data; (ii) discarding columns which\n",
        "contain unnecessary/redundant data; (iii) use of one-hot encoding to create numerical data\n",
        "from categorical variables; (iv) data balancing using downsampling techniques; (v) feature\n",

        "using train_test_split, and will then build the following three models for evaluation:\n",
        "1. K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN): this model will attempt to predict the severity of the\n",
        "accident in the test dataset based on the severity of the K accidents whose preceding\n",
        "conditions are most similar in the training dataset.\n",
        "2. Decision Tree: this model will build a decision tree by splitting and branching the\n",
        "data on all the possible values of every attribute in the dataset in order to determine\n",
        "the most predictive features in the dataset. The decision tree will then be used to\n",
        "predict the severity of an accident in the test dataset based on the values of those\n",
        "predictive features.\n",
        "3. Support Vector Machine (SVM): the target variable severitycode is not binary\n",

        "and then these hyperplanes will be used to predict the severitycode of accidents in\n",
        "the test dataset, given the values of its independent variables.\n",
